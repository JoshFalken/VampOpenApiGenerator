# VampOpenApiGenerator

This project generates an openapi-specification in Yaml-format (formerly known as Swagger 2.0) that can be used to generate an client. I'm still implementing the return types. The generated specification can be seen here: https://github.com/JoshFalken/VampOpenApiGenerator/blob/master/VampGenerator/vampopenapi.yaml
